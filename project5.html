            <p>A diabetes prediction system is a tool that uses machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on certain input data. This data can include personal characteristics such as age, weight, height, and family medical history, as well as lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity.</p>
            <p> The goal of such a system is to identify individuals at high risk for developing diabetes, so that preventive measures can be taken to reduce their risk or delay the onset of the disease.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed the project under supervised learning using support vector machine.</li>
                <li>The system takes BMI, blood glucose level, insulin level as input and predicts whether the person is diabetic. </li>
                <li>The workflow included applying proper EDA methods on dataset, traing and testing data and feeding it to the classifier model which would
                    return the output.
